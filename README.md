# Simple Weather News Page

Simple Weather News Page is a simple web page where it shows the weather from different cities of Japan: 
  - Tokyo
  - Yokohama
  - Kyoto
  - Osaka
  - Sapporo
  - Nagoya

### API used
This simple app uses OpenWeatherMap's Daily API (https://openweathermap.org/forecast5).

### UI/UX explained
I chose this UI to express minimalist theme. No need for any decorations. Simplicity is what it needs. The important thing is that users want to know the information of the weather.

### Message
